NABUCCO Framework (README)
==========================

NABUCCO Framework - Component Based and Model-Driven Development
The NABUCCO Framework is the modern approach for developing software in a model-driven way using a component model.

Requirements
------------
The Frameworks available in the Open Source environment for MDA and component based development are difficult to combine for an integrated solution. The NABUCCO Framework closes this gap and provides an extensive construction kit of subject-specific and technical solutions. The concepts required in the Enterprise environment (for example, multi-client capability, client-specific customizability, scalability and much more) are already an integral component of the Framework.

Overview
--------
* Tool neutral MDA approach with textual DSL
* DSL for components, services, data-types etc.
* User Interface for RCP, Web and Portal
* Eclipse Generator Plugin
* Supported by UML2 and other meta-models
* Direct creation of Java, XML
* Integrated up-to-date documentation
* Short turnaround times with the development
* Extendable through customized DSL
* NABUCCO is 100% Open Source

Solutions
---------
The NABUCCO Framework consists of an MDA approach with a separate DSL, as well as components based thereon, for the development of products and customized applications.

Objectives
--------------------------------
* Creation of reusable components
* Complete multi-client capability of all components
* Depiction of recurring functions (Best Practices)
* Independence from tools and special technologies
* Supported by UML as well as textual DSLs
* Fast development, paired with qualitatively high value results

=======================

For the development of components, NABUCCO applies a generic MDA approach together with the NABUCCO DSL. The generic MDA approach is independent from technology and open to UML, textual DSLs or, for example, XML based modeling.

The NABUCCO DSL provides a complete specification for the creation of highly complex applications, which are divided into components and closely follow the SOA approach.

The following elements can be modeled with the NABUCCO DSL

* Components
* Data-types
* Exceptions
* Messages
* Services and Service Operations
* User Interface elements (input fields, drop-down list boxes, tables, etc.)

The modeling is tool-neutral and occurs through textual modeling. Distributed teams and management in any version control system are optimally supported as a result. An Eclipse Plugin is available for the creation, which steers the creation progress.

The NABUCCO Framework can be used on various levels.

Use of the MDA approach for a customized MDA process with separate DSL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is where the MDA core of NABUCCO is exclusively used for the creation of a customized DSL (with UML or textual modeling)

Use of the NABUCCO DSL / Generator as a software factory
--------------------------------------------------------
Would you like to boost parts of the application development with MDA? This is where the NABUCCO DSL and the corresponding generators can go “out of the box” or help the generators with customized adjustments in order to optimize inconsistent application development and raise quality.

Development of new components for specific industries or customers
------------------------------------------------------------------
NABUCCO supports the development of new components as well as the development of components that already exist. If an industry or customer specific component is missing, they can be developed simultaneously.

Customizing existing components without coding
----------------------------------------------
The existing components can be customized in various ways without the code being altered.

* Internationalization
* GUI customization (colours, layout-alteration, labeling
* Clients and almost all list boxes

Expanding existing components for a customized solution
-------------------------------------------------------
NABUCCO components can be adapted extensively through Code-Customizing. The structure of an application is not predefined through the NABUCCO Framework, but rather defined over a configuration. This configuration can be adapted to an application on compilation of components.

* Expansion or replacement of existing functions through a new function
* Rendering of customer-specific behaviour through scripting
